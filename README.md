Frsky D (aka FrskyD) and Frsky Smart Port (aka FrskySP) libraries for Arduino.

Those two libraries were designed to sniff and build sensors for Frsky. They still are in early stage, but good enough to have fun with.

Each library is documented. Look at doc/html/index.html in each one of them. Here is an online copy:
